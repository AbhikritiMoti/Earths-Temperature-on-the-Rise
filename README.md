# Visualizing Earth's Rising Temperatures using Tableau


## Overview
In an era where climate change is a pressing global issue, understanding the impact of rising temperatures on Earth is crucial. With advancements in data visualization tools like Tableau, it has become easier to analyze and communicate complex data effectively. This project seeks to visualize the alarming trend of Earth's increasing temperatures using Tableau, providing a comprehensive overview of the temperature rise over time. The visualization encompasses historical temperature data from reliable sources, capturing trends over several decades. By displaying this data in an engaging and intuitive manner, it allows viewers to grasp the profound impact of rising temperatures and its implications for our environment, ecosystems, and society as a whole.

By presenting the data in a visually appealing and accessible format, this project aims to inspire meaningful conversations, encourage informed decision-making, and mobilize collective efforts towards a more sustainable future. Let us embark on this visual journey to gain insights into Earth's rising temperatures and take action to protect our planet for generations to come.

## Analysis
Data shows that the planet is getting hotter when measured by the annual deviations from the 1951-1980 mean temperature. This is used as a baseline for measurement. The chart highlights each annual temperature deviation from this baseline from 1880 to 2020 and shows that temperatres have risen significantly over the period causing the earth to become hotter.

Furthermore, the visualization incorporate additional elements such as color gradients, annotations, and interactive features to enhance the user experience. These elements can help to highlight specific milestones, notable events, or significant shifts in temperature trends, further emphasizing the gravity of the situation.
